1.  dentifying the main challenges of AI engineering from an AI and software engineering (SE) perspective, considering industrial needs and their current experiences:

-   Scalability: Developing AI systems that can handle large amounts of data and operate at a high level of performance is a major challenge.
-   Explainability: Developing AI systems that can explain their reasoning and decision-making process to humans is important for building trust and ensuring the accountability of the system.
-   Reliability: Ensuring that AI systems are robust and reliable in the face of unexpected inputs or changes in the environment is crucial for many industrial applications.
-   Integration with existing systems: Many industrial systems rely on legacy software and hardware, and integrating AI functionality into these systems can be a challenge.
-   Data Quality: Industrial process often generate dirty and noisy data. To properly train an AI system on this data, it's important to understand and preprocess the data, which can be hard.
-   Privacy and security: AI systems often rely on sensitive data, and ensuring the privacy and security of this data is crucial for both regulatory compliance and building trust in the system.
-   Human-AI interaction: Ensuring that AI systems can effectively interact with humans, and account for the cognitive biases and limitations of human users, is important for many industrial applications.

2.  Roadmap for AI engineering research in relation to the AI-based systems lifecycle:

-   Problem identification and formulation: Identifying the problem that the AI system is intended to solve and formulating it in a way that is amenable to AI solutions
-   Data collection and preprocessing: Collecting and preparing the data that will be used to train the AI system
-   Model development: Developing and training the AI model using the prepared data
-   Model evaluation and selection: Evaluating the performance of different AI models and selecting the best one for the problem at hand
-   Deployment: Deploying the selected model in the target system and monitoring its performance in the real-world
-   Maintenance and update: Continuously monitoring and improving the performance of the deployed model through regular updates, adjustments and retraining.

3.  Differences in approaches between data science and AI/ML and SE Data science is a field that focuses on the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. It relies heavily on statistical and machine learning techniques to extract insights from data. It is often considered as an interdisciplinary field that incorporates elements of computer science, statistics, and domain expertise. AI/ML refers to the specific subfield of computer science that deals with the development of algorithms and models that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, and decision-making. SE focuses on the development, maintenance, and evolution of software systems. It includes a wide range of activities such as requirements engineering, design, testing, and deployment. SE processes and methodologies can be applied to the development of AI systems to ensure that they are robust, reliable, and maintainable.
    
4.  Industrial challenges in building and using AI-enabled systems:
    

-   Data availability: Many industrial processes generate large amounts of data, but this data is often not readily available for use in AI systems due to a lack of standardization, data silos, or concerns about data privacy and security.
-   Lack of domain expertise: Building AI systems that can effectively operate in industrial settings often requires a deep understanding of the domain-specific knowledge and constraints. This can be a challenge for organizations that do not have in-house domain expertise.
-   Integration with existing systems: Integrating AI functionality into existing systems can be difficult due to technical challenges and organizational barriers.
-   Lack of explainability: Many industrial applications require that the AI system can explain its decision-making process to human stakeholders, but current AI models often lack explainability, which can make it difficult to build trust and ensure accountability.

-   Security and privacy: AI systems that operate in industrial settings often handle sensitive data, and ensuring the security and privacy of this data is crucial for both regulatory compliance and building trust in the system.
-   Human-AI interaction: Ensuring that AI systems can effectively interact with humans, and account for the cognitive biases and limitations of human users, is important for many industrial applications, but it is difficult to design and implement.
-   Align expectations: AI can be easily overhyped, which can lead to unrealistic expectations and disappointment. It is important for organizations to have a clear understanding of the capabilities and limitations of AI and align their expectations accordingly.

5.  Building a thriving community of SE, data science and AI practitioners and researchers

-   Establishing a collaborative platform for SE, data science and AI practitioners and researchers to share knowledge and experiences.
-   Organizing workshops and conferences to bring together researchers and practitioners from different domains to discuss current challenges and share best practices.
-   Encouraging the publication of research on SE, data science and AI in reputable journals and conference proceedings to increase visibility and impact.
-   Providing training and education opportunities for SE, data science and AI practitioners and researchers to keep them up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.
-   Support research that addresses the practical problems encountered in industrial settings and encourage the development of open-source software and tools to facilitate the deployment of AI systems in industry.

These are all interesting and important topics within the field of Software Engineering for AI. Here are a few possible directions for research that are related to these topics:

Requirements and modeling for AI/ML systems: Investigating the specific requirements and constraints that AI/ML systems impose on software development and how these can be captured and modeled using existing or new requirements engineering methodologies and tools.

Data management in AI/ML development: Examining the role of data in the development of AI/ML systems, including issues related to data quality, data integration, and data governance, and how these can be aligned with business goals.

Software architecture and integration of AI-based systems: Research on the design of software architectures for AI-based systems, and how to integrate AI/ML components into existing software systems, including the use of continuous and federated ML, and continuous deployment.

Non-functional properties and AI/ML systems: Investigating the trade-offs between AI/ML properties, such as accuracy and interpretability, and non-functional properties, such as performance, safety, security, reliability, and scalability, and developing approaches and techniques for managing these trade-offs.

Development teams, organizations and management for AI-systems: Examining the organizational and management challenges that arise in the development of AI-systems, such as building effective teams, managing data and model ownership, and dealing with stakeholder expectations.

Building effective infrastructure to support AI-systems: Research on the infrastructure, tooling, and platforms that support the development of AI-systems, such as distributed computing platforms, data processing frameworks, and model management systems.

This should give you some ideas on what could be the potential research areas, Keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list and there are many other possible directions for research in this field, depending on your interests and expertise.
