## The Standard of a Taxonomy

**Taxonomy** is the practice and science of [categorization](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Categorization) or [classification](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Classification_(general_theory)).[[Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Taxonomy)]

From my point of view, Taxonomy should be a scheme of classification that covers every item in the branches which does not overlap. 

When there is a new item, Taxonomy shall let people know how it can be classified. The boundary line between the categories should be clear.

The following steps could be used for developing a taxonomy of a topic.

## Do a Survey or Literature Review

The literature review is an essential part of the research. We cannot build taxonomy without understanding the concepts. Read paper keeps us updated with the latest developments and state-of-the-art technology. Many reports also detail discussed a topic as a review. We generally know the basis of a research field by reading about ten high-quality papers. 

We should also mind there might be taxonomy already published in papers. When we meet a taxonomy built by others, we should first think about how they classify the topic and if it makes sense. Do researchers and experts commonly accept this? Can we have another aspect of the view?

It is unnecessary to force ourselves to create a new type of taxonomy. We should think about is there any improvement to the classic taxonomy. We can do some further refining based on them.

## Develop a Taxonomy

Suppose there is already a solid taxonomy. We only need to consider how it is further refined and developed. Otherwise, we need to build a Taxonomy of our own. 

Firstly, we should be able to figure out the most critical feature that can classify the items. For example, in XAI, the black-box model and interpretable model have been debated and compared in many papers. They can be selected as the main categories. 

The parallel categories should always be in the same scope. We cannot compare two concepts that are not on the same level. Then, we need to refine each of the main categories and develop further branches by reviewing other papers until the concept is clear enough.

## Test the Taxonomy 

We may make mistakes while developing a taxonomy. It is necessary to test and evaluate the taxonomy. 

- Test the taxonomy using new samples. It should easily classify some new items that the user have never seen. 
- Brain-storming for each category to check if there are similar things forgotten.

## Construct well, and Long-term Maintain 

With the technology developing, some methods can be proven wrong, and new ways discovered. The new technology developed should also be added to the taxonomy. For example, Convolutional neural networks were the SOTA model and ruled the computer vision problem for many years. Recently, with the development of the transformer model, 

Vision Transformer (Vit) and many other contributions show better accuracy. [[Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)] Therefore, the VIT model should be added to the taxonomy. The new tech will not cause a reconstruction if the taxonomy is designed well.
