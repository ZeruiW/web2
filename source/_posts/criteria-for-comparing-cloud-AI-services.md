What are the qualitative and systematic criteria for comparing Cloud AI services?

## Brainstorming, what factors could be taken into account?

-   **Accuracy**: How well does the model perform on new data that it has not seen before? How close are its predictions to the ground truth labels? [Accuracy can be measured by various metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, etc. depending on the problem domain](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs/continuous-evaluation/view-metrics)[1](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs/continuous-evaluation/view-metrics)[2](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/evaluation/introduction).The proportion of correctly classified images out of the total number of images. [This is a simple metric for model evaluation, but it may not be suitable for imbalanced datasets or multi-class problems](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/evaluation-metrics-for-classification-models-e2f0d8009d69)[4](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/evaluation-metrics-for-classification-models-e2f0d8009d69). Accuracy can be measured using various metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. These metrics provide an objective measure of how well the model performs on different datasets.
	-    **Precision**: The proportion of correctly classified images out of the total number of images predicted for a given class. This metric measures how precise the model is in predicting a certain class[4](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/evaluation-metrics-for-classification-models-e2f0d8009d69).
	-   **Recall**: The proportion of correctly classified images out of the total number of actual images for a given class. [This metric measures how well the model can recall all the relevant images for a certain class](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/evaluation-metrics-for-classification-models-e2f0d8009d69)[4](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/evaluation-metrics-for-classification-models-e2f0d8009d69).
	-   **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. [This metric balances both precision and recall and gives a single score for each class](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/evaluation-metrics-for-classification-models-e2f0d8009d69)[4](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/evaluation-metrics-for-classification-models-e2f0d8009d69).
	-   **Confusion matrix**: A table that shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each class. [This matrix gives a comprehensive overview of the model’s performance across all classes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-understand-automated-ml)[5](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-understand-automated-ml).
-   **Scalability**: How well does the model handle increasing amounts of data and requests? How fast and efficient is it in terms of processing time and resource consumption? [Scalability can be measured by metrics such as throughput, latency, memory usage, CPU utilization, etc.](https://dev.ti.com/edgeai/)[3](https://dev.ti.com/edgeai/)
-   **Robustness**: How well does the model cope with noisy, incomplete or adversarial data? How resilient is it to changes in data distribution or environmental conditions? [Robustness can be measured by metrics such as error rate, sensitivity, specificity, robustness margin, etc.](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/cloud-ai-developer-services)[4](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/cloud-ai-developer-services)
-   **Explainability**: How easy is it to understand how the model works and why it makes certain decisions? How transparent and interpretable is its logic and reasoning? [Explainability can be measured by methods such as feature importance scores, saliency maps, decision trees, etc.](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/cloud-ai-developer-services)[4](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/cloud-ai-developer-services)
-   **Cost**: The amount of money charged by the service provider for using their image classification models. [This may depend on factors such as the number of transactions, the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model, and the duration of the training and deployment](https://www.bing.com/aclk?ld=e8jG9mNtMLVC7yGhQxO4H2ATVUCUw-oHzqZpCAMlxDMTrpZxWZNXTdoG1FvJSMsEj86RNyPbQXgvIiKOIY1EqMvhyx7d3Zt3j92sdpL5o8MQlxhlFXt_dQSh6Xy8ZoMxm_lw2FNELA5u0XTerxMjztavdrwqkTh9HlIaXIkwKzGAPmbz7Q&u=aHR0cHMlM2ElMmYlMmZhd3MuYW1hem9uLmNvbSUyZmZyZWUlMmZjb21wdXRlJTNmdHJrJTNkYzIzNTkxNGItZDBhZC00NTNjLTkwNzgtZGMxNTFjYzE3ZDExJTI2c2NfY2hhbm5lbCUzZHBzJTI2c19rd2NpZCUzZEFMITQ0MjIhMTAhNzExOTM2MDQ3MjE3MDEhNzExOTQxMjY3Nzc3MDMlMjZzX2t3Y2lkJTNkQUwhNDQyMiExMCE3MTE5MzYwNDcyMTcwMSE3MTE5NDEyNjc3NzcwMyUyNmVmX2lkJTNkZjlhNWFlMGE4MTVlMTFhODY3NzdjYTA4OWQ5Zjc3YWYlM2FHJTNhcw&rlid=f9a5ae0a815e11a86777ca089d9f77af)[1](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/)[2](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/migration/UJ1%20Vertex%20SDK%20AutoML%20Image%20Classification.ipynb). [Different providers may have different pricing schemes and offer free trials or credits for new users](https://www.bing.com/aclk?ld=e8jG9mNtMLVC7yGhQxO4H2ATVUCUw-oHzqZpCAMlxDMTrpZxWZNXTdoG1FvJSMsEj86RNyPbQXgvIiKOIY1EqMvhyx7d3Zt3j92sdpL5o8MQlxhlFXt_dQSh6Xy8ZoMxm_lw2FNELA5u0XTerxMjztavdrwqkTh9HlIaXIkwKzGAPmbz7Q&u=aHR0cHMlM2ElMmYlMmZhd3MuYW1hem9uLmNvbSUyZmZyZWUlMmZjb21wdXRlJTNmdHJrJTNkYzIzNTkxNGItZDBhZC00NTNjLTkwNzgtZGMxNTFjYzE3ZDExJTI2c2NfY2hhbm5lbCUzZHBzJTI2c19rd2NpZCUzZEFMITQ0MjIhMTAhNzExOTM2MDQ3MjE3MDEhNzExOTQxMjY3Nzc3MDMlMjZzX2t3Y2lkJTNkQUwhNDQyMiExMCE3MTE5MzYwNDcyMTcwMSE3MTE5NDEyNjc3NzcwMyUyNmVmX2lkJTNkZjlhNWFlMGE4MTVlMTFhODY3NzdjYTA4OWQ5Zjc3YWYlM2FHJTNhcw&rlid=f9a5ae0a815e11a86777ca089d9f77af)[1](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/).
-  **Time/Speed**:
-  **Ease of use**: The ease of use of the cloud AI service is an important factor to consider, as it can affect the adoption and usability of the service. The software should be easy to use and intuitive, with clear documentation and support available.
- **Carbon emission**: The amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by the service provider’s data centers and servers for running their image classification models. [This may depend on factors such as the location of the servers, the energy source used, and the efficiency of the hardware and software](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ais-carbon-footprint-problem)[3](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ais-carbon-footprint-problem)[4](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/02/good-news-about-carbon-footprint-of.html). [Some providers may use renewable energy or carbon offsets to reduce their environmental impact](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/ai-to-reduce-carbon-emissions)[5](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/ai-to-reduce-carbon-emissions)[6](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/09/23/how-cloud-migration-and-ai-can-help-reduce-carbon-footprint/).
- **Customization**: Some services allow for customization of the models to better fit specific use cases or domains.
- **Integration**: The ability to integrate the service with other cloud services and platforms can be important for some users.
- **Availability**: The availability of the cloud AI service can be an important factor to consider, as some services may only be available in certain regions or countries.
- **Pricing**: The pricing of the cloud AI service can vary widely, and it is important to compare the pricing models and costs associated with each service.
 - **Availability of APIs**: The availability of APIs for the cloud AI service can be important for developers who want to integrate the service into their own applications and workflows.
